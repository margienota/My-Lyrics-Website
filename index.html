          <h3>
          I dream a hundred dreams a minute (ey, ey)<br>
          And deep inside what I construct<br>
          So there's no use, don't even bother (ey, ey)<br>
          Tonight is not the night for us<br>
          I have a million shapes a decade (ey, ey)<br>
          I'm pass the point of no return<br>
          So don't even call, don't even bother (ey, ey)<br>
          'Cause I can't make you my concern<br>
          I'm runnin' faster than before<br>
          Beats and tunes and lovers<br>
          Cannot hold me back no more<br>
          I work alone<br>
          Is this all I'll ever know? Oh<br>
          And I remember all my childhood dreams<br>
          I find it hard to get them out of my mind<br>
          And I remember all my childhood dreams<br>
          I find it hard to get them out of my mind<br>
          And I remember all my-<br>
          So as the nighttime hits my window (ey, ey)<br>
          Sudden move to gain the lights<br>
          'Cause I'm not even close to done yet (ey, ey)<br>
          Well, I won't leave, I'm too inspired<br>
          And when the dawn emerges slowly (ey, ey)<br>
          I realized the night has passed<br>
          The suns I made were visionary (ey, ey)<br>
          Lookin' forward to go back<br>
          I'm runnin' faster than before<br>
          Beats and tunes and lovers<br>
          Cannot hold me back no more<br>
          I work alone<br>
          Is this all I'll ever know? Oh<br>
          And I remember all my childhood dreams<br>
          I find it hard to get them out of my mind (out of my mind)<br>
          And I remember all my childhood dreams<br>
          I find it hard to get them out of my mind<br>
